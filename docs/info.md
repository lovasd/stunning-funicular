## How it works

AND GATE is connected to IN0 AND IN1

This AND gates outputs a logic 1 if both IN0 AND IN1 are a logic 1, and a 0 otherwise.

This AND gate also drives segment A of the 7-segment LED dislay.

## How to test

Check if AND gate behaves as expected by testing all four combinations of inputs I0 and I1 and then ensuring that segment A turns OFF only when IN0 and IN1 are both a logic 1.

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
